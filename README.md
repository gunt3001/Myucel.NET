# Myucel.NET

Myucel.NET is a small library that search Reddit's /r/anime discussion threads using Reddit's search API.

It's something I made for myself to easily find anime discussion threads. I'm sure there are beter ways to do this. Currently even a slight typo can throw off Reddit search algorithm. 

Myucel.NET is a Portable Class Library targeting .NET 4.5, Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS and Silverlight 5.
